  ![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/login.png)

   ## User Registration (CIN)
This interface allows new users to begin their registration by entering their CIN (National Identity Card) number. The "Submit" and "Cancel" buttons allow you to validate or abandon the process, respectively.
 
  ![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/inscrire2.png)

   ## User Registration (Full)
After validating the CIN, the user accesses this interface to complete their registration. They must create a username and password and confirm it. A personalized welcome message is displayed (here for "mehdi darnakh").

   ![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/inscrire3.png)

   ## Password Recovery (Step 1)
For users who have forgotten their password, this interface allows them to begin the recovery process by entering the username and date of birth associated with the account.   

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/mdpo1.png)

   ## Password Recovery (Step 2)
After verifying the information, the user (here "Jane Smith") can enter a new password and confirm it. The interface is secure and intuitive for this critical process.   

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/mdpo2.png)

## Users list

The User Management interface displays a complete table of registered users, including their ID numbers, names, roles (admin, staff, or physician), and contact information. A search bar allows for quick filtering. The system enforces strict restrictions on the number of users per role: 1 administrator max, 4 staff members max, and 4 physicians max, ensuring secure access management. The "Action" column allows for account modification or deletion.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/users1.png)

## Add user
The Add User form allows the administrator to create new accounts by entering essential information (ID, name, role, date of birth, etc.). The system automatically checks the quotas per role before validation. This interface ensures that only authorized users are added, respecting the limits defined for each type of role.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/users2.png)

## Patient records management
This central interface allows physicians and administrators to search, add, and edit patient records. On the left, a drop-down list displays all registered patients; in the center, we find general information (ID, name, date of birth, gender, address, phone, email) and, below, the detailed appointment history (date, time, physician, reason, status and quick access to details). Two buttons "Modify Patient" and "Medical Record" allow data updates, while a "New Appointment" button offers a shortcut to schedule a future consultation. Physicians and the administrator have full access to this data, unlike staff, who only have limited access to insurance information.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/dossier1.png)

## Complete medical file (doctors & admin)

This "Patient Medical Record" view displays the patient's entire medical history: blood type, allergies, current treatments, blood pressure, chronic illnesses, surgical and family history, as well as the creation and last update dates. An editable form allows physicians and administrators to enter or correct this information, then save or discard changes via the buttons at the bottom of the page. Only these users have visibility and modification of all medical history.
![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/dossier2.png)

## Simplified view (personal)

In this stripped-down version of the file, only the administrative part is visible: it shows the creation date, the date of the last update, the insurance, and the policy number. The title indicates the patient's identity (national identity card and name), but staff only have access to the insurance information, without being able to view or modify the rest of the medical file.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/dossier3.png)

## Statistics
### 1. Rendez-vous Trends
In this tab, the administrator has an overview of appointment activity over the period selected via the filter panel (choice of the predefined interval or ‚ÄúFrom/To‚Äù dates). There are four key indicators at the top: the total number of appointments, completed and canceled appointments (with percentages), as well as the no-show rate. A pie chart details the distribution of statuses ‚Äì saved, scheduled, completed, missed, canceled, rescheduled ‚Äì and a histogram displays the number of appointments per week. Finally, two tables classify the busiest days and time slots, allowing you to identify peaks and troughs in activity.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/statistics1.png)

### 2. Patient Demographics
This tab provides the administrator with a comprehensive view of the patient mix during the selected period. It includes the total number of patients, the distinction between new and returning patients, and a pie chart for the male/female distribution. An adjacent histogram displays the distribution by age group (0-10, 11-20, etc.), revealing the most represented segments. Finally, a table lists the number of patients per physician, with percentages, to measure the commitment of each practitioner.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/statistics2.png)

### 3. Financial Performance
Here, the administrator can evaluate the revenue generated: total revenue, average revenue per appointment, and average revenue per patient, all in dirhams. The central histogram illustrates the weekly revenue trend, allowing the most profitable weeks to be identified. The table below breaks down revenue by doctor, indicating the number of appointments billed, total revenue, and each practitioner's relative share of the overall revenue.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/statistics3.png)

### Note :
These three statistics interfaces and the filter panel are strictly reserved for administrators; only they can access these reports and modify the data range via the filter section at the top of the screen.
## Payment
### 1. Main Payment Management Interface
The main payment management interface offers a dual-table layout for complete payment workflow management. The upper table displays today's completed appointments awaiting payment, allowing staff to search by patient CIN to quickly locate specific records. The lower table provides a comprehensive payment history with filtering capabilities by date and patient CIN, displaying payment details including amounts, methods, and patient information. Action buttons in both sections enable efficient payment processing, editing, and invoice generation, with a clear visual indication of payment status.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/payment1.png)

### 2. Payment Registration Dialog
The payment registration dialog presents a streamlined interface for recording new payments. It clearly displays the patient's name and appointment details at the top for verification, followed by simple input fields for the payment amount and a dropdown menu for selecting the payment method (Esp√®ces/Cash, Carte de Cr√©dit, Assurance). The clean, focused design eliminates distractions, allowing staff to quickly process payments with the prominent "Enregistrer" button, while the "Cancel" option allows easy return to the main interface if needed.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/payment2.png)

### 3. Payment Modification Dialog
The payment modification dialog provides a secure way to edit same-day payments with full accountability. It displays the payment ID being modified and allows staff to adjust the payment amount or change the payment method through a simple dropdown. The interface includes a mandatory reason field labeled "Raison de la modification (obligatoire)" that requires justification for any changes, ensuring proper documentation for audit purposes. The system preserves modification history while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface for quick adjustments.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/payment3.png)

### 4. Payment Invoice
The payment invoice presents a professional, well-structured receipt for patient payments. It features the clinic's information at the top, followed by clearly labeled sections for invoice details (number and date), patient information, appointment specifics (including doctor and reason for visit), and payment details (amount and method). The document includes designated signature areas for both staff and patient, providing a legally compliant record of the transaction. The clean, minimal design ensures all critical information is easily readable, making it suitable for both print and digital distribution.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/payment4.png)

## Daily Report
### 1. Daily Report Interface
The "Rapport Quotidien" interface provides clinic administrators with a comprehensive daily overview of appointment activity and patient flow. Users can easily select specific dates through the date picker at the top, with a prominent "T√©l√©charger en PDF" button allowing instant report export. The interface displays a warning that the report is partial if the day isn't finished yet. The report is organized into clear sections: a summary showing total appointments (4), completed appointments (4), cancellations (0), and total patients seen; a detailed patient list table showing each patient's CIN, name, appointment time, and payment method; and a patient flow analysis section highlighting peak hours and appointment distribution throughout the day. This at-a-glance dashboard gives administrators immediate insights into daily clinic operations.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/dailyReport1.png)

### 2. Daily Report Interface
The "Rapport Quotidien" interface provides clinic administrators with a comprehensive daily overview of appointment activity and patient flow. Users can easily select specific dates through the date picker at the top, with a prominent "T√©l√©charger en PDF" button allowing instant report export. The interface displays a warning that the report is partial if the day isn't finished yet. The report is organized into clear sections: a summary showing total appointments (4), completed appointments (4), cancellations (0), and total patients seen; a detailed patient list table showing each patient's CIN, name, appointment time, and payment method; and a patient flow analysis section highlighting peak hours and appointment distribution throughout the day. This at-a-glance dashboard gives administrators immediate insights into daily clinic operations.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/dailyReport2.png)

## Dashboard
### 1. Calendar View
This is the main calendar interface implemented in CalendarViewController.java and defined in CalendarView.fxml. It displays a time-based grid showing appointments for multiple doctors with color-coded status indicators. The interface includes navigation buttons, date selection, doctor and status filters, and a summary panel on the right showing daily statistics and upcoming appointments. The grid is dynamically populated with appointment blocks that can be clicked to manage appointments.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app1.png)

### 2. New Appointment Form
This appointment creation/editing interface is implemented in AppointmentFormController.java and defined in AppointmentForm.fxml. It provides a form for entering patient details (with search functionality), selecting doctors, choosing date and time, entering visit reasons, setting priority (normal or urgent), and adding notes. The form adapts based on whether it's creating a new appointment or editing an existing one, showing additional status options for existing appointments.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app2.png)

### 3. Appointment Actions (Scheduled Status)
This dialog is generated by the showAppointmentActionsDialog method in CalendarViewController.java. It displays actions available for a scheduled appointment, showing patient details and offering options to view/modify the appointment, register the patient's arrival (check-in), mark as missed, or cancel the appointment. These options change dynamically based on the current status of the appointment.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app3.png)

### 4. Appointment Actions (Checked-In Status)
Generated by the same method as Image 3, this dialog shows actions available for a checked-in patient. The patient is marked as "Enregistr√©" (registered/checked-in) and the dialog offers options to view/modify the appointment details or start the consultation, which would change the appointment status to "In Progress" through the handleStartAppointment method.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app4.png)

### 5. Appointment Actions (In Progress Status)
This dialog shows actions for an appointment currently in progress, created by the showAppointmentActionsDialog method. It displays details for a patient currently with the doctor and offers options to view/modify or complete the appointment. Selecting "Terminer" would trigger the handleCompleteAppointment method, prompting for final notes and changing the status to "Completed."

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app5.png)

### 6. Cancel Appointment Dialog
Implemented in the handleCancelAppointment method, this dialog allows users to cancel an appointment by selecting the cancellation type (by patient or by clinic) and entering a reason. The cancellation is processed differently based on the selected type, with the system tracking who canceled and when, stored in the Appointment object and database.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app6.png)

### 7. Mark as Missed Dialog
Created by the handleMissedAppointment method, this simple dialog prompts for a reason when marking a patient as absent from their appointment. Upon confirmation, it updates the appointment status to "Missed" and sets the noShowFlag to true in the database. This also potentially triggers the appointment shifting functionality to fill the gap.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app7.png)

### 8. Appointment Actions (Missed Status)
This dialog shows actions available for a missed appointment through the showAppointmentActionsDialog method. It displays the missed status and offers options to view/modify or reschedule the appointment. The reschedule option would trigger the handleRescheduleAppointment method which displays the rescheduling dialog.

![Interface de connexion](./screenshots/app8.png)

### 9. Reschedule Appointment Dialog
Generated by the handleRescheduleAppointment method, this dialog allows rescheduling a missed appointment by selecting a new date and time and providing a reason. The system creates a new appointment record while updating the original one to "Rescheduled" status with a reference to the new appointment ID, maintaining a history of the change.
